# Deformation fields
Image registration-based approach to investigate planar deformation during mechanical testig. 
## Pre-requisities
This application uses popular C++ image registration library [elastix](https://elastix.lumc.nl/) through [SimpleElastix](https://simpleelastix.github.io/) library in Python. SimpleElastix is very powerfull but the compilation on Windows is little painfull, however, if you will follow [instructions](https://simpleelastix.readthedocs.io/GettingStarted.html), everything should work fine.
